    <h1>VishwaCTF 2025 and how we meet FazeCT</h1>
    <div><p><img alt="test" src="img/fazeandduck.png" /></p>
<p>I took FazeCT pfp on dream hack ;-;</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>I’m a CTF beginner. I had only been playing CTFs for about 2–3 weeks, and honestly my results weren’t very good. Part of the reason was that I didn’t spend much time on CTFs. So that day, I decided to ask myself: what would happen if I seriously sat down and played one full CTF?
And that CTF was VishwaCTF 2025.</p>
<h2>The Competition</h2>
<p>My friend and I sat in a coffee shop and played from the afternoon until 11 PM before going home. We worked together quite well: I handled web + rev + pwn, while my friend Jaze played forensics + misc + OSINT. Everything was pretty fun, and in the end we reached top 16 — a very high position for us at that time.</p>
<p>However, the prizes weren’t meant for top 16 specifically:</p>
<p><code>text
For 6th – 15th place
i. PentesterLab License x1
ii. Real-World Bug Hunting E-book x1</code></p>
<p>A bit sad, but it was fine because we already had a really good time. Then the organizers announced that only teams who submitted write-ups would receive prizes. At that moment, a team named “FazeCT solo” did not submit their write-ups and gave up their slot for us.</p>
<p>We were extremely happy and immediately submitted our write-ups. Even though the prize wasn’t big, it was my first CTF prize ever, haha. We excitedly messaged him to say thank you and even invited him out for coffee </p>

<p>Unlike Jaze (who has been playing CTFs for almost 3 years), I had only been playing for 3 weeks, so I didn’t know anyone in the CTF or security community. I’m not even studying security as my major. So I just thought FazeCT was some random older guy, haha.</p>
<h2>Coffee</h2>
<p>That day, we met in a very fancy-looking area. Jaze seemed a bit shy because he knew these were big names in the CTF/security scene, while I had no idea who they were at all (who the hell is he ;-;).</p>
<p>That day, we met FazeCT, Zayn, and Cocay.
Only after that did I realize:</p>
<p>FazeCT is the leader of a top-tier CTF club at Bach Khoa, especially strong in reversing.</p>
<p>Zayn is a top crypto player at Bach Khoa.</p>
<p>Cocay is quiet, but clearly very skilled.</p>
<p>Bro… I had just started playing and already met the final bosses.</p>
<p>What was funny is that at the time, I thought they were just bragging to scare me, haha. Still, I’m very grateful to them for opening my eyes and sharing so many valuable pieces of advice.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>At the time of writing this blog, I now know how insanely good they all are.
But back then, I was just innocently sitting in a coffee shop with some random guys ;-;</p></div>
